# Markdown Renderer

A very simple, easy Markdown renderer. Takes an *.md file, transpiles it to an HTML file of the same name and in the same folder using Atlassian's commonmark, and displays the output in a Java Swing/FX app using a WebView component and accompanying CSS sheet. One can also delete the transpiled HTML file easily from the app.
